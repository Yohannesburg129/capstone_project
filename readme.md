# Capstone Project - Airline Customer Review

Hello Reader! This is a ReadMe file for Johann Manukulasuriya's capstone project that was submitted for BrainStation's Data Science course. 

The focus of this project was to use Natural Language Processing to predict whether airline customer reviews led to a Yes or No recommendation for the flight. 

The capstone_project folder contains the following:

Aviation has always been a passion of mine. I LOVE to travel. I love recognizing and naming all the different type of aircraft when I go to the airport to set off for my next holiday stop. I don't just focus on distinguishing between Airbus or Boeing. I go a bit deeper, like trying to see if I can tell if that Boeing 737 is an 800 or 700 model based on its winglets. I loved aviation so much that I pursued and graduated with an undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering, thinking I'm just one step closer to my goal of working in aviation. However it wasn't what I had expected it to be. I didn't expect Aerospace Engineering to be such a niche field, where experience mattered above all else. And it was with even greater regret that after 2 years of fruitless job searching, dead-end LinkedIn reach outs and fool-hearted belief that if I just kept applying I'd end up with an entry-level aerospace job, that I decided on a career switch. 

I decided to pursue Data Science because, unlike Aerospace Engineering, it is extremely versatile. It's a skill-set that can be used in **ANY** field. And right now, I would love nothing more than to get my fingers tired out from all the coding that's going to be required of me at my future position. But I haven't given up on my passion yet. To this day, I believe I can still make it in the aviation industry. Whether that be for an aircraft manufacturer like Boeing, or an airline like Air Canada, I know I want to end up in aviation.

But this time, it'd be as Data Scientist. 

I am excited for you all to see my project.
